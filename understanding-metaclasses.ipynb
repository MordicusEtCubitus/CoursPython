    "Numerous libraries, such as Django, use them in their internal mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a metaclass? It is a class whose instances are classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a class is a factory that creates variables called *class instances*. A metaclass is a factory that creates classes. Simply put, a factory that creates factories.\n",

    "\n",

    "In Python, everything is public. Therefore, the solution above does not apply. [Wikipédia provides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) a brief overview on how to implement the pattern. The page in [French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(patron_de_conception)) presents implementations in various languages, including Python.\n",

    "To implement a singleton class, we must prevent the creation of multiple instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are created in the constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is not the `__init__` function.\n",
    "The constructor is the function that creates the variable in memory.\n",
    "`__init__` is called to initialize the instance's attributes once the variable is created. It is the [`__new__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__) function that allocates the object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually never define it because Python manages memory itself. And it is much simpler this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we could redefine it so that it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* creates and stores a variable on the very first call\n",
